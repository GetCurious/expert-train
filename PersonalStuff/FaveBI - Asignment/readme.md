Fave Business Intelligence - Assignment Part (A)
Answer the following questions using data from the Transactions table. Preferably using SQL / Python, but feel free to use any tools that are familiar with (eg. Microsoft Excel)
											
1. What is the total revenue generated by each merchant throughout the period, sorted by highest to lowest? Also include the number of outlets each merchant has.

2. Build a summary table to show each merchant's monthly performance in the following:											
	- Total Revenue										
	- Total Unique Customers										
	- Total Transactions										
	- Average Price per Transaction
											
3. For each merchant, how many new customers are they getting every month, and for each month's new customers, how many % of them come back in the next month to make a transaction?
(new customers are users who make a transaction for the first time at a particular merchant)

4. Based on the questions answered from Section A and any other information you are able to derive from the Transactions table, provide a brief assessment on each of the merchants.
